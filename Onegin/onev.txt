My uncle used to be so sound, [1]
But after falling gravely ill [2]
Is craving homage, and has found [3]
That could not make a better deal. [4]
It is for others a good lesson, [5]
But what a boredom is the session: [6]
To watch a sick man day and night [7]
And do not make a step aside! [8]
What mean deceitfulness it is: [9]
To feign compassion, dose the drugs, [10]
To set and fluff the pillows, thus, [11]
To entertain a half deceased, [12]
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh [13]
And think: Oh gosh, when will you die! [14]
